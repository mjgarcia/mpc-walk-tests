\section{Formulation 16-17 (ALT.TERM.CONSTRAINT)}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Description}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Formulation 16: Similar to Formulation 4, but terminal equality constraints are 
        imposed on the state after an addition iteration, which uses the same constraints 
        on ZMP as the preceding iteration. (So the preview window is longer.)
    \item Formulation 17: Formulation 16 + constraint on foot positions from Formulation 14.
\end{itemize}
