\section{Formulation 2 (DECOUPLED, NOT COMPLETED)}\label{sec.form02}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Description}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The constraints on feet placement are simplified (replaced by rectangles)
    \item Dropped the term, which keeps the mean CoM speed close to the reference. The preview window,
    which is currently used, is shorter than required anyway. Also, it seems that this term is dropped
    in mpc-walkgen as well.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model of the system}
\begin{align*}
\cstate_{k+1}^x =& \M{A}_k \cstate_k^x + \M{B}_k \cjerk_k^x
&\cstate_{k+1}^y =& \M{A}_k \cstate_k^y + \M{B}_k \cjerk_k^y\\
z_{k+1}^x =& \M{D}_{k+1} \cstate_{k+1}^x
&z_{k+1}^y =& \M{D}_{k+1} \cstate_{k+1}^y\\
\end{align*}

\begin{equation*}
\M{A}_k = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    1       & T_k   & T_k^2/2   \\
    0       & 1     & T_k       \\
    0       & 0     & 1         \\
\end{bmatrix}
\quad
\M{B}_k =
\begin{bmatrix}
    T_k^3/6 \\
    T_k^2/2 \\
    T       \\
\end{bmatrix}
\quad
\M{D}_{k} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    1       & 0     & -h_k  \\
\end{bmatrix}

        \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
    \ZMP^x =

\begin{equation*}
    \cVel^x =
